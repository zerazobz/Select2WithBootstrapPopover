# Select2WithBootstrapPopover
Customize every "option" of Select2 using the bootstrap component PopOver


The purpose of this mini project is to combine the "options" from Select2 with PopOver from BootStrap, then every time that
I put the mouse over the Select2 "option" it should display a popover around the option.

Plugins used:
* Select2
* Bootstrap
* Handlebars
